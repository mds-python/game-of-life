# Game of Life

Your task is to create a [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Please read the Wikipedia article carefully to understand the game rules. You can also watch the video with an explanation of Conway's Game of Life from John Conway himself:

The user should be able to load a predefined board (see `sample_patterns` folder for the file format) or start the animation from the randomly generated one (of specified size).

In the most basic version you can just print `#` and `.` on a screen. However, this will result in the minimal mark. It is much better to use some graphics library (e.g. Matplotlib with [animations](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/) and [`imshow`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html)) or any other library of your choice).

Use whichever libraries or you need. Give it your own personal style. However, please mind that the quality of our code will be assessed. In any case, your code **must** object-oriented with a good separation between the logic and the presentation layer.

The main code must be run in the `life.py` file.
